- 👋 Hi, I’m @TWhela
- 👀 I’m a career changer who worked 9 years as a HGV mechanic before becoming a software engineer apprentice.
- 🌱 I studied at Makers before joining the team at AM Digital as an apprentice. Before that I was using tools like Codecademy and the ODIN project to learn about web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to build a collection of repositories that can grow and change along with my abilities and skill sets. I would love to hear from more experianced developers on how they began their careers and any advise I could be given.
