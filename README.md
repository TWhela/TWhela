- 👋 Hi, I’m @TWhela
- 👀 I’m interested in chaging my career from a HGV tech to a software dev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning with the help of the ODIN project where I will be building very basic webpages as I come to grips with with the fundimentals of some coding languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to build a collection of repositories that can grow and change along with my abilities and skill sets. I would love to hear from more experianced developers on how they began their careers and any advise I could be given.
