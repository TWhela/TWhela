ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TWhela

### ðŸŒ±Learning Journey
Iâ€™m a career changer who worked 9 years as a HGV mechanic before making the change into the tech industry. <br>
I studied at [Makers](https://makers.tech) before joining the team at AM Digital as a software engineer apprentice. Before that I was using tools like Codecademy and the ODIN project to learn about web development. <br> 
I'm now proud to be starting my new role as a **Junior Software Engineer at AM Digital** ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸ”¨ What I'm Working On
I'm working with AM in areas that grow my skills. I love learning new patterns and practices, and I'm starting to explore areas like:
- .NET and C#
- React and TypeScript
- Docker, cloud infrastructure (Azure) and terraform
